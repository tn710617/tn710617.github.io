<p>I'm a backend programmer</p><p> I was a career soldier. During the drills, I took sky as my quilt, and the earth as my bed, sitting on the meadow next to my comrades, exchanging knowing smiles, looking up the sky dotted with stars without light pollution, and of course, without taking a bath for over 1 week. It's such an unforgettable experience. Sometimes I lapsed into this kind of reminiscence. however, which, I don't want to experience anymore in the rest of my life.</p><p> I was an international salesman. I found that there was some uncannily striking resemblance between the insistence of Japanese on SOP, and that of Jew on cost. <br/>Actually, office staff in US does not get overtime pay either.<br/>The first time I met Dutch face to face, the first impression I got was if they were descended from The Giant <br/>In the battle, Jew has to wait for the first shot from their enemy and so they could fire back. "What if you got shot at the first shot from your enemy?" I asked. "Oh, that would be your fate" The Jew replied.</p><p>Currently I am a programmer. How lucky I am, I had a serendipity with coding. I like any form of languages. When I feel like talking to people, I speak human language. When I prefer to be alone, I speak machine language.<br/> I'm enamoured with the contrast between the delicacy and strictness of machine language. The nonstop developing technology constantly surprises me while fulfilling my great appetite for knowledge. <br/>I do not need an alarm every morning. The scalding blood in my vein wakes me up, and the excitement for a new day dissipates the sleepiness, because on this new day, I can think, I can learn, and convert my logic and idea into a sophisticated, elegant, and exquisite language. </p></p><br/><br/> <p>我是一個後端工程師。<br/> 我對terminal的黑色視窗情有獨鍾，可能是因為在我看過的駭客電影中，厲害的駭客都是在小小的黑畫面中施展他們的妖術，印象中好像沒有看過施展妖術前還要開UI的駭客...</p><p> 我曾是個職業軍人，天為被，地為枕，一個禮拜不洗澡，與弟兄們坐在野地上，相視一笑，仰望著深山沒有光害的星空，這是一種一輩子難忘但卻再也不想經歷的經驗。</p><p> 我也曾是個國外業務，發現日本人對於SOP，以及猶太人對於數字，有著異常相似的執著！<br/>其實美國辦公室人員加班也是沒有加班費的啦！<br/>第一次接觸荷蘭人，還以為他們是巨人族的後裔。<br/>猶太人在戰場上，需要等敵人開槍才可以反擊，於是我說："那如果敵人開槍你就掛了呢？"，猶太客戶回我說："嗯，那就是你的命了"。</p><p> 現在的我是個工程師，我很幸運，這輩子有幸跟coding邂逅。我喜歡任何形式的語言，當我想與人交流時，我說人類語言; 當我想獨處時，我說機器語言。<br/>機器語言的細膩與嚴謹深深的吸引我。日新月異的技術，在使我瞠目結舌之餘，不斷的充填我對知識永不枯竭的渴求。<br/>每天早晨，我不需要鬧鐘讓我起床，我的熱血喚醒我的身體，對新的一天的興奮感吹散我的睡意，因為今天的我，還可以思考，學習，並將我的邏輯，轉換成細緻而優美的機器語言。
